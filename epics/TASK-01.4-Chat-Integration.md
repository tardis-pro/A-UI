## Goal

Implement an intelligent chat system that leverages the AI's memory and knowledge base to facilitate meaningful discussions between multiple agents and the user. The system should maintain context awareness, utilize relevant knowledge, and support collaborative problem-solving.

## Sub-Tasks

1. **Backend: Enhanced Chat Processing System:**
   * Implement `ChatManager` with:
     * Context tracking
     * Memory integration
     * Multi-agent coordination
   * Add conversation analysis:
     * Topic detection
     * Intent recognition
     * Knowledge relevance scoring
   * Implement agent selection logic:
     * Expertise matching
     * Task requirements
     * Context relevance

2. **Backend: Memory-Aware Chat Endpoints:**
   * `POST /api/chat/message` with:
     * Context-aware processing
     * Knowledge base integration
     * Multi-agent routing
   * `GET /api/chat/context` for:
     * Active discussion context
     * Relevant knowledge items
     * Agent states
   * `POST /api/chat/agents` for:
     * Agent selection
     * Expertise querying
     * Task assignment

3. **Frontend: Intelligent Chat Interface:**
   * Create `DiscussionHub` component with:
     * Multi-agent chat display
     * Context visualization
     * Knowledge integration
   * Add `AgentPanel` showing:
     * Active agents
     * Agent expertise
     * Task progress
   * Implement chat features:
     * Context-aware suggestions
     * Knowledge references
     * Code integration

4. **Memory Integration:**
   * Connect with `MemoryManager` for:
     * Conversation history
     * Knowledge retrieval
     * Context maintenance
   * Implement memory features:
     * Important point tracking
     * Decision recording
     * Solution evolution
   * Add conversation summarization

5. **Local Model Integration:**
   * Configure chat-specific models for:
     * Message understanding
     * Context processing
     * Response generation
   * Implement efficient processing
   * Add model management

6. **Multi-Agent Coordination:**
   * Implement agent communication:
     * Message routing
     * Context sharing
     * Task coordination
   * Add collaboration features:
     * Shared knowledge access
     * Task breakdown
     * Solution synthesis

## Definition of Done

- Chat system effectively utilizes memory and knowledge
- Multi-agent discussions work smoothly
- Context awareness is maintained throughout conversations
- Knowledge integration enhances responses
- All processing happens locally
- Response latency under 2 seconds
- Memory system tracks conversation context
- System handles complex discussions efficiently

## Notes

- Focus on meaningful agent interactions
