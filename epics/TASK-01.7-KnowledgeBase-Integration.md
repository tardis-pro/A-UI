# TASK-01.7: Knowledge Base & Memory System Integration

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started
**Priority:** P0: Critical (upgraded from P2)
**Parent Epic:** [EPIC-01: UI-Backend Integration](EPIC-01-UI-Backend-Integration.md)
**Depends On:** [TASK-01.3: Frontend API Service Module](TASK-01.3-Frontend-API-Service.md)
**Related Feature:** [12-KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md](../00-FEATURE-LIST.md)
**Assignee:** TBD
**Estimate:** 8-10 hours (increased due to expanded scope)

## Goal

Implement a robust knowledge base and memory system that serves as the AI's brain, capable of ingesting, processing, and retrieving information from various sources using local models. This system will power semantic search, context-aware responses, and multi-agent discussions.

## Sub-Tasks

1. **Backend: Implement Knowledge Ingestion Pipeline:**
   * Create `KnowledgeIngestManager` class to handle different source types:
     * Local files (MD, TS, PY, etc.)
     * Git repositories
     * Documentation
     * Conversation history
   * Implement chunking strategies based on content type using `CodeChunker`
   * Generate embeddings using local models (via Ollama)
   * Store in local vector DB (ChromaDB/LanceDB) for fast retrieval
   * Implement background processing for large ingestion tasks

2. **Backend: Create Memory Management System:**
   * Implement `MemoryManager` class with:
     * Short-term memory (recent conversation context)
     * Long-term memory (vector store)
     * Working memory (active task context)
   * Add memory consolidation logic:
     * Periodic review of short-term memory
     * Important context promotion to long-term memory
     * Relevance scoring for memory retrieval
   * Implement memory cleanup/pruning strategies

3. **Backend: Define Enhanced Knowledge Search Endpoints:**
   * `POST /api/memory/ingest` for adding new knowledge
   * `POST /api/memory/search` for semantic search with:
     * Query text
     * Context type (code, docs, conversations)
     * Relevance threshold
     * Time range filters
   * `GET /api/memory/context` for retrieving active context
   * `POST /api/memory/update` for updating existing knowledge

4. **Frontend: Implement Knowledge Management UI:**
   * Create `KnowledgeManager` component with:
     * Source configuration panel
     * Ingestion progress tracking
     * Memory visualization
   * Add `ContextPanel` component showing:
     * Active memory items
     * Relevant code snippets
     * Related conversations
   * Implement search interface with:
     * Natural language queries
     * Filter controls
     * Result visualization

5. **Integration with Multi-Agent System:**
   * Modify `AgentOrchestrator` to:
     * Access shared knowledge base
     * Maintain agent-specific memory contexts
     * Use memory for response generation
   * Update prompt templates to include:
     * Relevant memory snippets
     * Context awareness
     * Cross-reference capabilities

6. **Local Model Integration:**
   * Configure Ollama endpoints for:
     * Text embedding generation
     * Semantic search
     * Context processing
   * Implement fallback strategies
   * Add model management interface

## Definition of Done

- Knowledge ingestion pipeline successfully processes various source types
- Memory system effectively manages short-term and long-term storage
- Search queries return relevant results within 500ms
- UI components render and interact smoothly
- Multi-agent system effectively utilizes shared knowledge
- All operations work with local models
- Memory usage stays within reasonable bounds
- System handles large knowledge bases efficiently

## Notes

- Focus on local model support for independence from external APIs
- Prioritize search performance and result relevance
- Implement proper memory cleanup to prevent unbounded growth
- Consider adding knowledge graph visualization in future iterations
- Add monitoring for memory usage and search performance
