# EPIC-01: UI-Backend Integration for AUI MVP

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started
**Priority:** P0: Critical
**Related Features:** [05-API-INTEGRATION.md](../00-FEATURE-LIST.md), [11-CODE-ASSISTANT.md](../00-FEATURE-LIST.md), [17-CODE-SEARCH.md](../00-FEATURE-LIST.md), [16-CICD-MONITOR.md](../00-FEATURE-LIST.md), [12-KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md](../00-FEATURE-LIST.md), [13-COMMAND-HISTORY.md](../00-FEATURE-LIST.md)

## Goal

Integrate the existing React frontend (`app/`) with a Python FastAPI backend to create a functional MVP. This leverages our existing Python ecosystem (cognee, embeddings, etc.) while providing a modern async API server. The integration involves setting up the FastAPI server, defining REST endpoints, implementing the frontend API client, and ensuring concurrent development.

## User Stories

- As a developer using AUI, I want to type a message in the chat interface and receive a response generated by the backend LLM (Ollama).
- As a developer using AUI, I want the chat history to be persistent and loaded when I open the application.
- As a developer using AUI, I want to perform a code search from the UI and see results fetched from the backend's vector database.
- As a developer using AUI, I want to see the status of CI/CD pipelines displayed in the UI, fetched from the backend tracker.
- As a developer using AUI, I want to query the knowledge base from the UI and see relevant results.
- As a developer using AUI, I want to view my recent command history in the UI, fetched from the backend analyzer.

## Technical Requirements

- FastAPI server with async/await support
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Integration with existing Python components:
  - cognee for knowledge management
  - Local embeddings via Ollama
  - Vector storage (ChromaDB/LanceDB)
- REST API endpoints with OpenAPI documentation
- Frontend refactored to use API calls
- Concurrent execution of frontend (Vite) and backend (FastAPI) servers
- Proper Python dependency management (poetry/requirements.txt)
- Basic error handling and logging

## Definition of Done

- FastAPI server initializes with all required Python dependencies
- OpenAPI documentation is available and accurate
- Frontend successfully communicates with the Python backend
- Core functionalities integrated and working:
  - Chat with memory system
  - Code search with semantic understanding
  - Knowledge base with local embeddings
  - CI/CD monitoring
  - Command history analysis
- Development environment runs both servers concurrently
- Basic error handling and logging implemented
- No direct imports of Python modules in the React frontend

## Notes

- FastAPI chosen for:
  - Native async/await support
  - Automatic OpenAPI documentation
  - Easy integration with Pydantic models
  - High performance
- Initial focus on core chat functionality
- Use Python's async capabilities for non-blocking operations
- Leverage existing cognee setup for knowledge management
- Consider using WebSocket for real-time features later
- Implement proper CORS handling for development
