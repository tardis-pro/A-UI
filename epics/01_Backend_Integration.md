# Epic: Backend Integration and API Infrastructure

## Description

This epic focuses on building a comprehensive, scalable, secure, and resilient backend infrastructure to support the multi-agent discussion arena. Key activities include designing and implementing RESTful API endpoints for core functionalities (agent management, discussion lifecycle, message handling), setting up a robust server environment (using FastAPI for backend services), configuring database connections (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, vector databases) with appropriate schema design and connection pooling, and integrating these components seamlessly with the frontend and the core discussion management logic. The system will include AI model integration, knowledge management, code processing, and real-time communication capabilities. Emphasis will be placed on creating stateless API services where possible to enhance scalability and fault tolerance.

## User Stories

- **As a frontend developer,** I want stable and well-documented API endpoints with a strongly-typed TypeScript SDK for agent configuration, discussion initiation, and message retrieval, so I can build the user interface components efficiently and reliably.
- **As the Discussion Manager system,** I want to persist discussion state (participants, messages, context, current turn) via backend API calls, so that discussions can be paused, resumed across sessions, or recovered after interruptions.
- **As a system administrator,** I want secure authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth) and role-based authorization implemented for all API endpoints, so that application data is protected from unauthorized access and actions.
- **As a developer,** I want comprehensive logging implemented across backend services, so I can effectively debug issues and monitor system health.
- **As an LLM integration developer,** I want standardized interfaces for model serving and streaming responses, so I can efficiently handle AI-powered interactions.
- **As a knowledge base engineer,** I want API endpoints for knowledge storage and retrieval, so I can manage semantic search and information extraction.
- **As a code analyst,** I want efficient code processing and vector database operations for semantic code analysis and search capabilities.

## API Architecture Components

## Potential Pitfalls

- **Inadequate API Design:** Creating endpoints that are too granular or too coarse, leading to chatty interactions or tight coupling between frontend and backend.
- **Poor Database Schema:** Inefficient schema design or lack of proper indexing causing performance bottlenecks.
- **Insufficient Error Handling:** Lack of standardized error responses and inadequate handling of edge cases.
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Failure to implement proper authentication, authorization, input validation, or rate limiting.
- **Scalability Bottlenecks:** Architecture choices that hinder the system's ability to handle increasing load.
- **Vendor Lock-in:** Over-reliance on specific cloud provider services without considering portability.
- **LLM Response Handling:** Inadequate streaming implementation causing delays or UI freezes.
- **Vector Database Performance:** Inefficient vector operations affecting semantic search capabilities.

## Good Practices

- **Standard API Design:** Adhere to RESTful principles with clear naming conventions and consistent response structures.
- **API Versioning:** Implement versioning from the start to manage breaking changes gracefully.
- **Stateless Services:** Design backend services to be stateless when possible for improved scalability.
- **Comprehensive Logging & Monitoring:** Integrate structured logging and monitoring tools.
- **Testing Strategy:** Implement unit tests, integration tests, and contract testing.
- **Security First:** Implement security best practices including HTTPS, secure auth, and input validation.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Use tools like Terraform or Pulumi for infrastructure management.
- **Database Migrations:** Use tools like Alembic for systematic schema management.
- **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.
