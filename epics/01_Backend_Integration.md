# Epic 1: Backend Integration and API Infrastructure

## Description

This epic focuses on building a scalable, secure, and resilient backend infrastructure to support the multi-agent discussion arena. Key activities include designing and implementing RESTful API endpoints for core functionalities (agent management, discussion lifecycle, message handling), setting up a robust server environment (using FastAPI for backend services), configuring database connections (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, vector databases) with appropriate schema design and connection pooling, and integrating these components seamlessly with the frontend and the core discussion management logic. Emphasis will be placed on creating stateless API services where possible to enhance scalability and fault tolerance.

## User Stories

- **As a frontend developer,** I want stable and well-documented API endpoints for agent configuration, discussion initiation, and message retrieval, so I can build the user interface components efficiently and reliably.
- **As the Discussion Manager system,** I want to persist discussion state (participants, messages, context, current turn) via backend API calls, so that discussions can be paused, resumed across sessions, or recovered after interruptions.
- **As a system administrator,** I want secure authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth) and role-based authorization implemented for all API endpoints, so that application data is protected from unauthorized access and actions.
- **As a developer,** I want comprehensive logging implemented across backend services, so I can effectively debug issues and monitor system health.
- **As an LLM integration developer,** I want standardized interfaces for model serving and streaming responses, so I can efficiently handle AI-powered interactions.
- **As a knowledge base engineer,** I want API endpoints for knowledge storage and retrieval, so I can manage semantic search and information extraction.

## API Architecture Components

### Authentication Layer
- JWT token-based authentication
- OAuth2 with Password flow
- Session management with persistence
- Role-based permissions for different user types

### API Interface Components
- **Request Management**:
  - FastAPI dependency injection for service resolution
  - Request caching using Redis
  - Rate limiting to prevent overload
  - Request prioritization for critical operations

- **Response Management**:
  - Response caching for frequent queries
  - Streaming support for LLM outputs
  - Consistent error handling patterns
  - Data validation using Pydantic models

### Real-time Communication
- WebSocket support for streaming agent responses
- Server-Sent Events for status notifications
- Connection management and reconnection handling
- Channel management for multiple discussions

## Potential Pitfalls

- **Inadequate API Design:** Creating endpoints that are too granular or too coarse, leading to chatty interactions or tight coupling between frontend and backend. Not following REST principles consistently.
- **Poor Database Schema:** Inefficient schema design or lack of proper indexing causing performance bottlenecks, especially as discussion history grows.
- **Insufficient Error Handling:** Lack of standardized error responses and inadequate handling of edge cases, making frontend integration and debugging difficult.
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Failure to implement proper authentication, authorization, input validation, or rate limiting, exposing the system to potential attacks.
- **Scalability Bottlenecks:** Architecture choices (e.g., stateful services, inefficient database queries) that hinder the system's ability to handle increasing load or concurrent discussions.
- **Vendor Lock-in:** Over-reliance on specific cloud provider services without considering portability.
- **LLM Response Handling:** Inadequate streaming implementation causing delays or UI freezes when displaying long model outputs.

## Good Practices

- **Standard API Design:** Adhere to RESTful principles or consider GraphQL for complex data fetching needs. Use clear naming conventions and consistent response structures.
- **API Versioning:** Implement API versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/...`) from the start to manage breaking changes gracefully.
- **Stateless Services:** Design backend services to be stateless whenever possible, relying on external stores (database, cache) for state management to improve scalability and resilience.
- **Comprehensive Logging & Monitoring:** Integrate structured logging (e.g., JSON format) and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog) to track performance, errors, and usage patterns.
- **Testing:** Implement a robust testing strategy including unit tests (for business logic), integration tests (for API endpoints and database interactions), and potentially contract testing.
- **Security First:** Implement security best practices: HTTPS, secure authentication/authorization, input validation, output encoding, rate limiting, secrets management (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider secrets managers).
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Use tools like Terraform or Pulumi to manage infrastructure provisioning and configuration.
- **Database Migrations:** Use tools like Alembic (Python) or Flyway (Java) to manage database schema changes systematically.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

- All core API endpoints (agent CRUD, discussion lifecycle management, message handling) are implemented, tested (unit & integration), and documented using a standard like OpenAPI/Swagger.
- Backend services are containerized (e.g., using Docker).
- Deployment scripts/configurations (e.g., Docker Compose, Kubernetes manifests) are created for local development and staging environments.
- Authentication and basic role-based authorization are implemented and enforced on relevant endpoints.
- Structured logging is implemented for key events and errors.
- Basic monitoring dashboards (e.g., request rates, error rates, latency) are set up for the staging environment.
- Database schema is finalized, and migration scripts are in place.
- Security review (manual or automated scan) completed, and critical/high vulnerabilities addressed.
- Backend successfully deployed and operational in a staging environment, passing E2E smoke tests initiated from the frontend or API client.

## End-to-End (E2E) Flows

1.  **Agent Creation:**
    - Frontend sends POST request to `/api/v1/agents` with agent configuration.
    - API Gateway routes request to Agent Service.
    - Agent Service validates input, creates agent data.
    - Agent Service interacts with Database to persist the new agent.
    - Agent Service returns `201 Created` response with agent details to Frontend.

2.  **Discussion Start:**
    - Frontend sends POST request to `/api/v1/discussions` with initial context (document ID, selected agents).
    - API Gateway routes to Discussion Service.
    - Discussion Service validates input, fetches agent details, creates a new discussion record in the Database.
    - Discussion Service potentially interacts with Agent Service(s) to initialize agent states if needed.
    - Discussion Service determines the first speaker and returns `201 Created` response with discussion ID and initial state to Frontend.

3.  **Message Posting & Turn Progression:**
    - Frontend sends POST request to `/api/v1/discussions/{id}/messages` with message content and author.
    - API Gateway routes to Discussion Service.
    - Discussion Service validates, persists the message in the Database, linking it to the discussion.
    - Discussion Service updates discussion state (e.g., conversation history).
    - Discussion Service determines the next agent to speak based on turn logic.
    - Discussion Service potentially triggers the next agent's turn (e.g., via an event queue or direct call to Agent Service).
    - Discussion Service returns `201 Created` or `200 OK` response to Frontend, possibly including the updated discussion state or just confirmation.
    - (Asynchronous) Agent Service receives trigger, processes context, generates response, and posts it back via the `/api/v1/discussions/{id}/messages` endpoint.
