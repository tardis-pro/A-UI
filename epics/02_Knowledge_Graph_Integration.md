# Epic 2: Knowledge Graph and Data Integration

## Description

This epic focuses on establishing a robust system for agents to access and reason over diverse, domain-specific knowledge bases. The core idea is to ingest data from various enterprise sources (JIRA for project tracking, Git repositories for code history/structure, Confluence for documentation, PDFs for specifications/research papers, databases for schemas/data) into a unified knowledge representation, likely a graph database or a vector database optimized for semantic search. This involves building data pipelines (connectors) for extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), implementing chunking and embedding strategies for unstructured data (like PDFs and Confluence pages), and creating a secure, efficient API for agents to perform semantic searches against this aggregated knowledge.

## User Stories

- **As an Agent,** I want to query a knowledge base using natural language questions or keywords related to the current discussion topic (e.g., "What are the key requirements for feature X in the latest PRD?", "Show me recent code changes related to the authentication module", "Find relevant JIRA tickets for bug #123"), so I can ground my responses and contributions in accurate, relevant context.
- **As a Discussion Participant (Human or Agent),** I want the system to automatically retrieve and present relevant snippets from the knowledge base based on the ongoing conversation, so that key information is readily available without manual searching.
- **As a Knowledge Base Administrator,** I want a reliable process to configure, monitor, and update the data connectors for various sources (JIRA, Confluence, Git, etc.), so that the knowledge graph remains current and accurate.
- **As a Developer,** I want a clear API definition for the semantic search service, including filtering capabilities (by source, date range, document type), so I can integrate knowledge retrieval into agent logic and UI components.
- **As a Content Manager,** I want to store, classify, and retrieve knowledge items with appropriate metadata, so I can maintain an organized knowledge base.

## Knowledge Management API Components

### Core API Services

1. **Knowledge Service API:**
   - **Purpose**: Provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and searching knowledge items
   - **Key Endpoints**:
     - `/api/v1/knowledge/items` - CRUD operations for knowledge items
     - `/api/v1/knowledge/search` - Semantic search with filters
     - `/api/v1/knowledge/extract` - Extract knowledge from provided content
     - `/api/v1/knowledge/classify` - Classify and tag knowledge items

2. **Vector Database Integration:**
   - **Purpose**: Manages vector embeddings for semantic search
   - **Key Components**:
     - ChromaDB/LanceDB for vector storage and retrieval
     - Embedding generation service for text-to-vector conversion
     - Batched operations for efficient bulk processing
     - Filter implementations for metadata-based filtering

3. **Knowledge Classification System:**
   - **Purpose**: Automatically classifies and tags knowledge items
   - **Key Features**:
     - Automated tagging based on content analysis
     - Relationship detection between knowledge items
     - Confidence scoring for knowledge quality
     - Source tracking and provenance

### Data Structures

```typescript
// Knowledge Item Structure
interface KnowledgeItem {
  id: string;                // Unique identifier
  content: string;           // Actual knowledge content
  type: KnowledgeType;       // EXPLICIT, TACIT, PROCEDURAL, etc.
  source: KnowledgeSource;   // Source information
  tags: string[];            // Classification tags
  timestamp: Date;           // Creation/modification time
  relatedItemIds: string[];  // Related knowledge items
  confidence: number;        // Quality/confidence score (0-1)
  metadata: Record<string, any>; // Additional metadata
}

// Knowledge Source Structure
interface KnowledgeSource {
  type: SourceType;          // CONFLUENCE, JIRA, GIT, PDF, etc.
  identifier: string;        // Original source identifier
  url?: string;              // Link to original source
  author?: string;           // Original author
  lastUpdated?: Date;        // Last update timestamp
}
```

### Search Capabilities

- **Vector Similarity Search**: Find semantically similar content using cosine similarity
- **Hybrid Search**: Combine vector similarity with keyword/regex matching
- **Filtered Search**: Apply metadata filters (source, date, tags) to narrow results
- **Entity-based Search**: Find knowledge related to specific entities (projects, features)
- **Contextual Relevance**: Boost relevance based on recency and confidence

## Potential Pitfalls

- **Data Heterogeneity:** Handling the diverse formats, structures, and access methods of different data sources (APIs, file systems, databases) can be complex.
- **Scalability of Ingestion:** Processing large volumes of data (e.g., entire codebases, years of JIRA tickets) can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. Need efficient incremental updates.
- **Embedding Quality & Chunking Strategy:** The effectiveness of semantic search heavily depends on the quality of text embeddings and the strategy used for chunking large documents. Poor choices can lead to irrelevant search results.
- **Search Relevance Tuning:** Achieving high relevance for semantic search often requires experimentation and tuning of embedding models, indexing parameters, and potentially re-ranking algorithms.
- **Access Control & Permissions:** Ensuring that agents only access knowledge they are authorized to see (respecting source system permissions like JIRA/Confluence restrictions) is critical and complex to implement correctly.
- **Stale Data:** Keeping the knowledge graph synchronized with rapidly changing source systems (especially code repositories) requires efficient incremental update mechanisms.
- **Cost of Embedding & Storage:** Generating embeddings and storing them (especially in vector databases) can incur significant computational and storage costs.
- **Classification Accuracy:** Automatic classification systems may make incorrect assignments, requiring human verification or confidence thresholds.

## Good Practices

- **Modular Connector Architecture:** Design data connectors as independent modules, making it easier to add, update, or remove sources.
- **Incremental Updates:** Implement mechanisms for incremental data ingestion and embedding updates rather than full re-processing whenever possible.
- **Metadata Preservation:** Store rich metadata alongside ingested data (source, timestamps, permissions, original links) to aid filtering, provenance tracking, and access control.
- **Hybrid Search:** Consider combining semantic (vector) search with traditional keyword search (e.g., using Elasticsearch or OpenSearch) for better recall and handling of specific terms/identifiers.
- **Evaluation Framework:** Establish metrics and processes to evaluate search relevance and continuously improve embedding models and chunking strategies.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Use message queues or background job systems (e.g., Celery, RQ, Kafka Streams) for data ingestion and embedding pipelines to avoid blocking API requests.
- **Vector Database Optimization:** Choose and configure a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, Chroma) appropriately based on scale, performance needs, and filtering requirements.
- **Fine-tuning Embedding Models:** Consider fine-tuning embedding models on domain-specific data for improved relevance if general-purpose models prove insufficient.
- **Caching Strategy:** Implement caching for frequent queries to reduce vector DB load and improve response times.
- **Batch Processing:** Use batch operations for embedding generation and database operations to improve throughput.

## End-to-End (E2E) Flows

1.  **Data Ingestion (e.g., Confluence Page Update):**
    - Monitoring system detects a change in a configured Confluence space (e.g., via webhook or polling).
    - Ingestion pipeline triggers the Confluence connector.
    - Connector fetches updated page content and metadata.
    - Content is processed: cleaned, chunked into smaller pieces.
    - Chunks are sent to the Embedding Service to generate vector embeddings.
    - Embeddings, chunk text, and metadata are stored/updated in the Vector Database and potentially a relational DB/metadata store.

2.  **Agent Semantic Search Query:**
    - Agent determines the need for external knowledge based on discussion context.
    - Agent formulates a natural language query (e.g., "latest requirements for user login flow").
    - Agent Service calls the Knowledge Search API (`POST /api/v1/knowledge/search`) with the query and filters (e.g., `source: confluence`, `type: prd`).
    - Search Service converts the query text into an embedding vector.
    - Search Service queries the Vector Database using the query vector to find semantically similar chunks.
    - Search Service potentially re-ranks results based on metadata (recency, importance).
    - Search Service retrieves corresponding text chunks and metadata.
    - Search Service applies access control checks based on the requesting agent/discussion context.
    - Search Service returns the filtered, relevant text snippets and metadata to the Agent Service.
    - Agent incorporates the retrieved knowledge into its reasoning process and response generation.

3.  **Knowledge Creation and Classification:**
    - User or Agent submits new knowledge content via API (`POST /api/v1/knowledge/items`).
    - Knowledge Service validates the input data.
    - Knowledge Service sends content to Classification Service for automatic tagging.
    - Classification Service analyzes content and assigns appropriate tags and type.
    - Knowledge Service generates an embedding via Embedding Service.
    - Knowledge Service stores the item in the database with metadata.
    - Knowledge Service adds the embedding to the vector database.
    - The knowledge item is now available for search and retrieval.
