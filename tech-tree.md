Open Source Technologies for Implementation
Based on the architecture we've designed, here's a comprehensive list of open source technologies you'll need to build this system:
Code Chunking & AST Parsing

Tree-sitter - Language-agnostic parsing system that can build concrete syntax trees
Language-specific parsers:

Python: ast module, Jedi
JavaScript/TypeScript: TypeScript Compiler API, Babel
Java: JavaParser
Go: go/ast package
Rust: rust-analyzer
C/C++: Clang LibTooling


SonarQube - For code quality analysis and metrics collection

Vector Database & Embeddings

Milvus - Open-source vector database with support for embedding storage and retrieval
Qdrant - Vector database focused on extended filtering with payloads
FAISS - Facebook AI Similarity Search for efficient vector operations
Weaviate - Open-source vector search engine with semantic schema

Graph Database

Neo4j - Industry-standard graph database with temporal and spatial capabilities
JanusGraph - Distributed graph database with multi-backend support
DGraph - Native GraphQL database designed for modern applications

Machine Learning & Embedding Models

Hugging Face Transformers - For pre-trained code models like CodeBERT
PyTorch - For model fine-tuning and custom model training
Sentence Transformers - For generating text embeddings
CodeT5 - Pre-trained model for code understanding
StarCoder - Open-source code generation and understanding model

NLP & Processing Pipeline

spaCy - Industrial-strength NLP library
NLTK - Natural Language Toolkit for text processing
Apache OpenNLP - Tools for processing natural language text
StanfordNLP - Suite of human language technology tools
Apache Airflow - Workflow orchestration for complex data pipelines

Storage & Caching

PostgreSQL - Relational database for structured metadata
MongoDB - Document database for semi-structured data
Redis - In-memory data structure store for caching
MinIO - High-performance object storage for chunk storage
Elasticsearch - Search and analytics engine for text search

API & Service Layer

FastAPI - Modern API framework for Python
GraphQL - Query language for APIs with schema support
gRPC - High-performance RPC framework
Apache Kafka - Distributed event streaming platform
RabbitMQ - Message broker for service communication

Frontend & Visualization

D3.js - Library for data visualization
Cytoscape.js - Graph theory library for visualization and analysis
React - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
Monaco Editor - Code editor that powers VS Code

Containerization & Orchestration

Docker - Container platform
Kubernetes - Container orchestration platform
Helm - Package manager for Kubernetes

Monitoring & Logging

Prometheus - Monitoring system and time series database
Grafana - Observability and data visualization platform
ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) - For log management
Jaeger - End-to-end distributed tracing

Development & Testing

GitLab CI/CD or GitHub Actions - For continuous integration
pytest and JUnit - For testing
pre-commit - Git hook framework

Integration Components

Langchain - Framework for developing LLM-powered applications
Git libraries:

libgit2 (C library with bindings)
PyGit2 (Python bindings)
JGit (Java implementation)


OpenAPI - Specification for machine-readable interface files

Knowledge Graph Construction

rdflib - Python library for working with RDF
Apache Jena - Framework for building semantic web applications
SPARQL - Query language for RDF
Grakn/TypeDB - Hypergraph database with logical inference

Each of these technologies addresses specific requirements in the architecture we've defined. The implementation would start with core components (chunking, embedding, storage) and gradually expand to include the more advanced features of the hypergraph knowledge architecture.
