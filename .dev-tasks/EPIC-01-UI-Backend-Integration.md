# EPIC-01: UI-Backend Integration for AUI MVP

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started
**Priority:** P0: Critical
**Related Features:** [05-API-INTEGRATION.md](../00-FEATURE-LIST.md), [11-CODE-ASSISTANT.md](../00-FEATURE-LIST.md), [17-CODE-SEARCH.md](../00-FEATURE-LIST.md), [16-CICD-MONITOR.md](../00-FEATURE-LIST.md), [12-KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md](../00-FEATURE-LIST.md), [13-COMMAND-HISTORY.md](../00-FEATURE-LIST.md)

## Goal

Integrate the existing React frontend (`app/`) with the Node.js backend logic (`store/`) to create a functional MVP. This involves setting up a backend server, defining APIs, modifying the frontend to consume these APIs, and ensuring both run concurrently.

## User Stories

- As a developer using AUI, I want to type a message in the chat interface and receive a response generated by the backend LLM (Ollama).
- As a developer using AUI, I want the chat history to be persistent and loaded when I open the application.
- As a developer using AUI, I want to perform a code search from the UI and see results fetched from the backend's vector database.
- As a developer using AUI, I want to see the status of CI/CD pipelines displayed in the UI, fetched from the backend tracker.
- As a developer using AUI, I want to query the knowledge base from the UI and see relevant results.
- As a developer using AUI, I want to view my recent command history in the UI, fetched from the backend analyzer.

## Technical Requirements

- Backend server running Node.js (using TypeScript).
- REST API for communication between frontend and backend.
- Frontend refactored to use API calls instead of direct `store/` imports.
- Concurrent execution of frontend (Vite) and backend servers during development.
- Initialization of `AgentOrchestrator` and its dependencies (LLM provider, VectorDB, etc.) on the backend.
- Basic error handling for API calls.

9.  [TASK-01.9: Concurrency Setup for Development](TASK-01.9-Concurrency-Setup.md) ðŸ”´

## Definition of Done

- Backend server initializes and runs without errors.
- Frontend successfully communicates with the backend via defined APIs.
- Core chat functionality (send message, receive response) is working.
- Code Search, CI/CD Monitor, Knowledge Base, and Command History sections display data fetched from the backend (even if basic).
- Frontend and backend can be started with a single `npm run dev` command.
- No direct imports of `store/` modules remain in the `app/` directory.

## Notes

- Initial focus is on the chat flow. Other integrations (Code Search, CI/CD, etc.) can be basic display-only for the first pass.
- Error handling should be implemented but doesn't need to be exhaustive for the MVP.
- Tool execution approval flow is deferred beyond this initial integration epic.
- Streaming responses for chat can be implemented as a follow-up task.
