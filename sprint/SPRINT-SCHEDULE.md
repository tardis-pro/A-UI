- Knowledge Graph Setup (**Complete**)
- Basic CRUD Operations (**Complete**)
- Vector Database Integration (**Complete**)

**Summary:**
All Sprint 2 deliverables are complete. The project now has a fully functional knowledge graph system with vector database integration, complete API integration, and robust CRUD operations. The system is ready for communication features in Sprint 3.

## Sprint 3
**Start Date**: Week of June 10, 2025
**Theme**: Communication Features
- Chat Integration (🟡 In Progress)
  - ✅ Basic chat functionality
  - ✅ Real-time updates
  - ✅ Message persistence
  - ❌ Chat UI components pending
- Activity Feed (🟡 In Progress)
