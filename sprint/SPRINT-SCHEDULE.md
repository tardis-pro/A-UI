# Sprint Schedule

## Sprint Cycle Details
- Sprint Duration: 2 weeks
- Planning: Monday start of sprint
- Retrospective: Friday end of sprint
- Daily Standups: 10:00 AM

## Sprint 1 (Completed)
**Start Date**: Week of May 13, 2025
**Theme**: Foundation & Core UI
- Theme System Implementation (**Complete**)
- Layout Components (**Complete**)
- Backend Server Setup (**Complete**, see `/server`)
- API Definition (**Complete**, REST endpoints, OpenAPI, client integration)

**Summary:**
All Sprint 1 deliverables are complete. The project now has a robust theme system, modular layout, fully functional backend server (FastAPI, modular routes, Docker), and a well-defined API with client integration. Ready to begin Sprint 2.

## Sprint 2 (Completed)
**Start Date**: Week of May 27, 2025
**Theme**: Backend Integration & Knowledge Base
- API Integration Implementation (**Complete**)
- Knowledge Graph Setup (**Complete**)
- Basic CRUD Operations (**Complete**)
- Vector Database Integration (**Complete**)

**Summary:**
All Sprint 2 deliverables are complete. The project now has a fully functional knowledge graph system with vector database integration, complete API integration, and robust CRUD operations. The system is ready for communication features in Sprint 3.

## Sprint 3
**Start Date**: Week of June 10, 2025
**Theme**: Communication Features
- Chat Integration (üü° In Progress)
  - Basic chat functionality implemented
  - Real-time updates pending
- Activity Feed (üü° In Progress)
  - Activity tracking system in development
  - Notification system pending
- Command History (üü° Partially Complete)
  - ‚úÖ Core logging functionality
  - ‚úÖ Basic API routes
  - ‚ùå Backend services needed
  - ‚ùå Advanced features pending
- Real-time Updates (üü° In Progress)
  - WebSocket foundation ready
  - Integration pending

**Current Status**: Sprint 3 is in progress. Command History module requires significant backend work. Core functionality exists but needs to be moved from store layer to proper backend services. Additional security, scheduling, and template features needed.

**Risks and Mitigation**:
- Backend service completion may extend beyond sprint
- Security validation needs thorough review
- Performance optimization required for search features

## Sprint 4
**Start Date**: Week of June 24, 2025
**Theme**: Code Intelligence
- Code Search
- Code Assistant
- Code Navigation
- Context Management

## Initial Milestones
1. End of Sprint 1: UI Foundation Complete (**Achieved**)
2. End of Sprint 2: Backend Integration Working (**Achieved**)
3. End of Sprint 3: Basic Feature Set Usable
4. End of Sprint 4: Code Intelligence Features Active

## Risk Mitigation
- API Definition completed by end of Week 1 (**Done**)
- Knowledge Graph schema finalized by Sprint 2 (**Done**)
- Testing infrastructure in place by Sprint 3
- Performance metrics established by Sprint 4
