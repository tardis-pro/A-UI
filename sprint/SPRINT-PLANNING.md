# Sprint Planning

## Sprint 2 Status Update
**Sprint 2 is complete.** All high priority tasks (API integration, knowledge graph setup, CRUD operations, vector database integration) are finished. No remaining blockers. Ready to begin Sprint 3.

## Previous Sprint (Sprint 2)
**Focus**: Backend Integration & Knowledge Management

### High Priority Tasks
1. API Integration
   - Implemented API client
   - Set up error handling
   - Added request/response interceptors
   - Status: **Complete**

2. Knowledge Base Setup
   - Initialized knowledge graph structure
   - Set up vector database
   - Implemented basic CRUD operations
   - Status: **Complete**

### Dependencies & Blockers
- None remaining for Sprint 2. Knowledge Graph integration is complete.
- Communication features require stable knowledge base (to be addressed in Sprint 3).

## Next Sprint (Sprint 3)
**Focus**: Communication Features

### Planned Tasks
1. Chat Integration
   - Implement real-time chat system
       - **Implementation Details:** Utilize Socket.IO for real-time bidirectional communication between the server and clients. This library simplifies WebSocket management and provides fallback mechanisms for older browsers.
       - **Technologies:** Node.js (server-side), Socket.IO (WebSocket library), React (client-side).
       - **Considerations:** Ensure proper scaling and load balancing for the Socket.IO server to handle a large number of concurrent connections.
   - Set up WebSocket connections
       - **Implementation Details:** Configure Socket.IO on both the server and client sides. The server will listen for incoming connections and manage the distribution of messages. Clients will establish connections to the server and subscribe to relevant channels.
       - **Technologies:** Socket.IO, WebSocket API.
       - **Considerations:** Handle connection errors, disconnections, and reconnection attempts gracefully. Implement heartbeats to detect broken connections.
   - Add message persistence
       - **Implementation Details:** Store chat messages in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to ensure persistence across sessions. Implement a mechanism to retrieve historical messages when a user joins a chat.
       - **Technologies:** PostgreSQL, Sequelize (ORM), Redis (for caching).
       - **Considerations:** Design the database schema to efficiently store and retrieve messages. Implement proper indexing and caching to optimize query performance.

2. Activity Feed
   - Create activity tracking system
       - **Implementation Details:** Implement a system to track user activities within the application. This could include actions like creating, updating, or deleting data, as well as interactions with various features. Store these activities in a database with relevant metadata (timestamp, user ID, activity type, affected data).
       - **Technologies:** PostgreSQL, Sequelize (ORM), Redis (for caching).
       - **Considerations:** Design the database schema to efficiently store and query activity data. Implement proper indexing and caching to optimize performance. Consider using a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous processing of activity data.
   - Implement notification system
       - **Implementation Details:** Develop a notification system to alert users of important events or updates. This could include email notifications, in-app notifications, or push notifications. Use a service like SendGrid or Mailgun for email notifications. For in-app notifications, use WebSockets to push updates to the client in real-time.
       - **Technologies:** SendGrid/Mailgun (email), Socket.IO (WebSockets), Redis (for caching).
       - **Considerations:** Implement a notification preference system to allow users to customize the types of notifications they receive. Ensure that notifications are delivered reliably and efficiently.
   - Add real-time updates
       - **Implementation Details:** Use WebSockets to provide real-time updates to the activity feed. When a new activity is recorded, push an update to all connected clients. Implement a mechanism to handle disconnections and reconnections gracefully.
       - **Technologies:** Socket.IO (WebSockets), Redis (for caching).
       - **Considerations:** Optimize WebSocket connections to minimize latency and bandwidth usage. Implement proper error handling and logging to ensure that updates are delivered reliably.

3. Command History
   - Implement command logging (**Partially Complete**)
       - ✅ Core logging functionality implemented in `store/code-chunker/command-history.ts`
       - ✅ Basic API routes defined
       - ❌ Backend service implementation needed
       - ❌ Database schema implementation needed
       - **Implementation Details:** Complete backend service implementation, including proper database schema, security validation, and error handling. Move core functionality from store layer to backend services.
       - **Technologies:** TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, FastAPI
       - **Considerations:** Ensure proper security measures, implement rate limiting, add audit logging

   - Add history search (**Partially Complete**)
       - ✅ Basic search API endpoint defined
       - ✅ Vector store integration ready
       - ❌ Advanced search features needed
       - ❌ Search optimization needed
       - **Implementation Details:** Implement advanced search functionality with filters, date ranges, and command types. Optimize search performance with proper indexing.
       - **Technologies:** TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL (with indexing), Vector Store
       - **Considerations:** Implement efficient search algorithms, proper indexing, and pagination

   - Create replay functionality (**Partially Complete**)
       - ✅ Basic command execution structure
       - ❌ Security validation needed
       - ❌ Command scheduling needed
       - ❌ Command templates needed
       - **Implementation Details:** Implement secure command execution with proper validation, scheduling capabilities, and template management.
       - **Technologies:** TypeScript, Node.js, FastAPI, Redis (for scheduling)
       - **Considerations:** Implement strict security measures, proper error handling, and execution monitoring
