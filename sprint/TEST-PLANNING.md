# Test Planning

## Sprint 1 Status
All Sprint 1 test targets (unit, integration, E2E for theme, layout, API, state management) are now in place and coverage is being tracked. Sprint 2 will focus on extending tests to knowledge graph, backend integration, and CRUD operations.

## Test Strategy by Phase

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core UI
1. Unit Tests
   - Theme system color management
   - Layout component responsiveness
   - State management store operations
   - API client methods

2. Integration Tests
   - Theme switching workflow
   - Layout composition
   - API endpoint integration
   - State persistence

3. E2E Tests
   - Complete UI navigation flow
   - Theme persistence across sessions
   - API error handling scenarios

### Phase 2: Core Features
1. Unit Tests
   - Knowledge graph operations
   - Chat message handling
   - Command history storage
   - Code search indexing

2. Integration Tests
   - Real-time communication
   - Knowledge base CRUD operations
   - Code intelligence features
   - Context management

3. Performance Tests
   - Knowledge graph query speed
   - Search response times
   - WebSocket message handling

## Test Setup Requirements

### Development Environment
```typescript
// tests/setup.ts
import '@testing-library/jest-dom'
import { server } from './mocks/server'

beforeAll(() => server.listen())
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers())
afterAll(() => server.close())
```

### Test Categories
1. Component Tests
   - React Testing Library
   - Jest snapshots
   - Event handling

2. API Tests
   - Mock Service Worker
   - API contract testing
   - Error scenarios

3. State Management Tests
   - Store operations
   - Action dispatching
   - State transitions

## Coverage Requirements
- Components: 90%
- Business Logic: 95%
- API Integration: 85%
- Utils/Helpers: 90%

## Continuous Integration
- Pre-commit hooks for unit tests
- PR checks for integration tests
- Nightly E2E test runs
- Coverage reports in CI pipeline
