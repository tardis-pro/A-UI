âœ… AI Integration Knowledge Graph (Structured Schema v1)
ðŸŽ¯ Nodes (Entities)
Each has: type, description, interfaces, security, and relations.

CodeAssistant
Type: Module

Description: Provides code generation, suggestions, and debugging assistance using local (ONNX/Mistral) or optional external LLMs.

Interfaces: pm.ts, ai.ts, code-chunker.ts

Security: Local-first; external calls gated by explicit user consent

Relations:

Uses â†’ VectorDB

Triggered By â†’ Orchestrator

Communicates With â†’ PromptManager

KnowledgeBase
Type: System

Description: Unified store of code, tickets, docs, commands; supports retrieval & inference

Interfaces: embedding-gen.ts, command-history.ts

Security: All local unless external retrieval is configured

Relations:

Fed By â†’ CommandHistoryAnalyzer, CodeChunker

Queried By â†’ PromptManager, CodeAssistant

CommandHistoryAnalyzer
Type: Tool

Description: Extracts patterns from CLI logs to auto-suggest or execute workflows

Interfaces: orchestrator.ts, embedding-gen.ts

Relations:

Feeds â†’ KnowledgeBase

Observed By â†’ Orchestrator

Automates â†’ ShellOps

VectorDB
Type: Storage Layer

Description: Chroma/Qdrant for storing embeddings from code/doc chunks

Relations:

Read By â†’ PromptManager, CodeAssistant

Written By â†’ EmbeddingGenerator, CodeChunker

PromptManager (pm.ts)
Type: Coordination Layer

Description: Assembles prompts using system messages, recent history, and semantic context

Relations:

Sends To â†’ LLMProvider

Pulls From â†’ KnowledgeBase, VectorDB, CI/CD Tracker, Jira Integration

AI Module (ai.ts)
Type: Provider Abstraction

Description: Manages model selection, local/remote execution, token counting, streaming

Interfaces: LLMFactory, PromptManager

Security: Escalation to cloud requires opt-in

Relations:

Instantiates â†’ ONNXProvider, OllamaProvider

Interfaces With â†’ LLMFactory

CI/CD Tracker
Type: Monitor Module

Description: Pulls pipeline data from Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab, etc.

Security: Local fetches; external API keys stored securely

Relations:

Feeds â†’ PromptManager, Dashboard

Pulls From â†’ ExternalAPIs

Jira Integration
Type: API Service

Description: Connects to Jira via REST API, uses Zod schemas and optional MCP server

Relations:

Provides Tools To â†’ LLM

Syncs With â†’ CI/CD Tracker, KnowledgeBase

SecurityModel
Type: Policy System

Description: Manages user permissions, sandboxing, token usage

Relations:

Governs â†’ AI Module, Jira Integration, LLM Escalation
