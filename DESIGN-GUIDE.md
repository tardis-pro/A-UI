# A-UI Design Guide

This document outlines the core design principles and guidelines for the A-UI project.

## Core Principles (Inspired by The Zen of Python)

- **Beautiful is better than ugly:** Strive for clean, elegant, and aesthetically pleasing code and UI.
- **Explicit is better than implicit:** Make intentions clear in code and interfaces.
- **Simple is better than complex:** Prefer simpler solutions when possible, but don't oversimplify.
- **Complex is better than complicated:** If complexity is necessary, manage it well to avoid complication.
- **Flat is better than nested:** Avoid deep nesting in code structures and UI layouts where possible.
- **Sparse is better than dense:** Allow for whitespace and clear separation in code and UI elements.
- **Readability counts:** Write code and design interfaces that are easy to understand.
- **Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules:** Maintain consistency, but...
- **Although practicality beats purity:** Be pragmatic and choose practical solutions over dogmatic adherence to rules if necessary.
- **Errors should never pass silently:** Implement robust error handling and clear error messages.
- **Unless explicitly silenced:** Only suppress errors when there's a deliberate reason.
- **In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess:** Seek clarity rather than making assumptions.
- **There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it:** Design clear and intuitive workflows and APIs.
- **Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!:** Use modules, classes, and clear naming conventions to organize code effectively.

## Architecture

- **Microservices:** Break down functionality into smaller, independent services where appropriate (e.g., Jira integration, potentially AI model serving).
- **Modularity:** Design components with clear responsibilities and well-defined interfaces.
- **Event-Driven:** Utilize events for communication between components where appropriate (e.g., `EventEmitter` in Node.js) to decouple services.

## Coding Style & Practices

- **Language:** Primarily TypeScript.
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** (Specify frameworks like React/Vue/Svelte for frontend if applicable, Node.js libraries like Express, Axios, etc.)
- **Style Guide:** Adhere to a standard style guide (e.g., Prettier, ESLint with recommended configurations). Enforce automatically.
- **Pure Functions:** Prefer pure functions whenever possible to improve testability and predictability.
- **Immutability:** Use immutable data structures where practical.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Use `async/await` for managing asynchronous code.
- **Error Handling:** Use `try/catch` blocks for synchronous errors and `.catch()` for Promises. Provide meaningful error messages.
- **Testing:** Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests. Use a testing framework like Jest or Vitest. Track test coverage.
- **Dependency Management:** Use npm/yarn for managing Node.js dependencies. Keep dependencies updated.
- **Typing:** Leverage TypeScript's static typing features. Use interfaces and types for clear data contracts.
- **Logging:** Implement structured logging using a standard library (e.g., Winston, Pino). Log important events, errors, and decisions.
- **Configuration:** Manage configuration through environment variables or dedicated configuration files (e.g., `.env`).

## UI/UX Design (If Applicable)

*(This section needs details if there's a user interface)*

- **Framework:** (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- **Component Library:** (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design, Tailwind CSS, etc.)
- **Design System:** Reference any existing design system or component library guidelines.
- **Responsiveness:** Ensure the UI is responsive across different screen sizes.
- **Accessibility (a11y):** Follow WCAG guidelines to ensure the application is accessible.
- **User Experience:** Focus on intuitive navigation, clear feedback, and efficient workflows.
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistent visual styles, terminology, and interaction patterns throughout the application.

## API Design

- **RESTful Principles:** Follow REST principles for API design where applicable.
- **Clear Naming:** Use clear and consistent naming conventions for endpoints and resources.
- **Versioning:** Implement API versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/...`).
- **Authentication/Authorization:** Secure endpoints appropriately.
- **Request/Response Formats:** Use JSON for request and response bodies.
- **Status Codes:** Use standard HTTP status codes correctly.
- **Error Responses:** Provide consistent and informative error responses.
- **Documentation:** Document APIs using a standard like OpenAPI (Swagger).

## Documentation

- **Code Comments:** Use JSDoc/TSDoc comments for explaining complex logic, functions, classes, and interfaces.
- **READMEs:** Maintain up-to-date README files at the root and within key directories (`.features`, `.tdd`, service directories).
- **Architecture Diagrams:** Include diagrams in the `arch/` directory to illustrate system structure.
