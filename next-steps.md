AUTONOMOUS ULTRA INSTINCT (AUI) Implementation: Next Steps
Great progress on building the core modules of AUI! You've implemented most of the fundamental components needed for a functional AI-powered developer agent. Here's what you should focus on next:
Immediate Implementation Priorities

Complete the React UI Components

Finish the Chat Interface implementation with tool approval flows
Implement the terminal emulator component that can execute commands
Build the code diff viewer for file changes
Complete the CI/CD dashboard with real-time status updates


Electron Main Process Integration

Set up IPC communication between the React frontend and backend modules
Implement file system watchers to detect code changes
Create proper error handling and logging systems
Build the tray/menu integration for desktop app experience


Local LLM Integration

Complete the ONNX runtime server setup for running local models
Implement proper model quantization for performance
Add model downloading and management features
Create fallback mechanisms for when local processing is insufficient


Testing and Deployment

Set up unit and integration tests for core components
Create packaging scripts for distributing the Electron app
Implement telemetry (with user consent) for error tracking
Build an auto-updater system



Technical Improvements

Vector Database Optimization

Implement proper caching for embeddings
Add incremental updating for code changes
Optimize search with better filtering mechanisms


Context Management

Improve token counting accuracy and context window utilization
Add summarization techniques for long contexts
Implement sliding window management for long conversations


Security Enhancements

Add proper credential encryption
Implement sandboxing for code execution
Create granular permission model for tools



Roadmap for 5-Day Refinement
Day 1: UI/UX Finalization

Complete all React components
Integrate IPC communication
Set up event handling between modules

Day 2: Local LLM Integration

Finish ONNX server implementation
Optimize performance on target hardware
Implement prompt engineering improvements

Day 3: Knowledge Management

Enhance Jira/GitHub integration
Improve documentation parsing
Add knowledge classification refinements

Day 4: Testing & Optimization

Comprehensive testing across components
Performance profiling and optimization
Memory management improvements

Day 5: Packaging & Deployment

Create installers for major platforms
Documentation creation
User onboarding experience

Key Implementation Challenges to Address

Context Window Management: Effective handling of limited context windows in LLMs
Performance Balancing: Finding the right balance between local processing and external API usage
Tool Integration: Creating a seamless and secure mechanism for tool execution
User Experience: Ensuring the app remains responsive despite heavy local processing

This approach will ensure you have a functional MVP that can be refined into a production-ready solution through the subsequent phases.
